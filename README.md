**Application Summary:**

The main emphasis of the ImageWorld app is image sharing with the other users, hence, the name ImageWorld. The application consists of a feature for creating captions too. Users can log in or sign up to the application to utilize it. Upon visiting, users will be redirected to the main web screen. Here they can see images uploaded by others, the typical combination of E-mail and password for user authentication. Images appear on the main web page from the customers that are in the customer checklist. The application is into three parts. 

One for watching pictures, one for selecting individuals, and the 3rd one are for uploading photos. That is my first
effort to develop and code the android application. I realized to establish something which I directly utilize regularly. I obtained inspiration from Instagram as it is just one of my most used social media platforms. Even though building something like Instagram is past the scope of the project, I attempted to comply with the format of Instagram as long as I could follow it. To achieve my objectives, I needed aid from a few standards that are referenced later on.


<br />

<br />

<br />



**Project Description**

The proposed application for picture sharing will probably contain several vital as well as essential features. That is to make the use of the application less complicated to all the clients using it. The application is freely accessible to use with the option of no IAP (in-app purchases) incorporated. Every individual will certainly have complete access to the software application by installing it on their android smartphone device. 

The suggested capabilities and features that will remain in the application are below:



<br />

<br />

<br />




**Feature’s list:**


**1.	User Registration and Login:**
After starting the android application, the individuals will first look at the screen to log in or Sign up. For accessing the application, users need to be registered first. The register option will provide customers the capability to enter their name, email as well as password. After effectively entering the info, users can enter the login credentials and details for accessing the ImageWorld application.  
Figure 1: Depicts the design of the register and login web page of the application.

**2.	Upload Photo from Gadget with Caption:**
The primary screen of the application will be, divided into two components. The main page will be for the customer to post images, and the other page will be for viewing others' pictures. In the image publishing section, the application will give a button to choose any of the photos from the customer device and a text field for individuals to let them write subtitles and captions. After the selection of the picture process by the user, by pushing the submit button, the selected image will be published as well as can be seen from the primary page of the application.
 


**3.	View Photos Uploaded by Other Customers/Users:**
As stated previously, the second page of the android application will be for viewing images. Within this section, users can see their uploaded photos in addition to images published by various other users.


**4.	Select Certain Individuals:**
There will be one recommended feature in the application that will be choosing individuals.  They will submit images that will certainly show up on the primary page so that the user can see their image from there.

**5.	Infinite Scrolling:**
The proposed application will feature the boundless scrolling performance so that the customer can see all uploaded photos only by swiping the screen up or down in the application.


To offer a correct overview of the application as just how it will certainly function.

**Technical Specifications of Application**

The suggested image sharing application will be coded in Kotlin programming language using Android Studio . The application will be functional on any android device having Android OS 5 or greater. According to the data provided by Android Studio, this should cover 99.9% of android gadgets in operation as of today.

This application will need Firebase as its backend server. All images, captions, individual qualifications will be dealt with by the Firebase server . That is a cloud infrastructure established. That is maintained by Google that enables any individual to utilize the service for free. It helps to manage server-side programming. Aside from fundamental server functionalities, Firebase additionally supplies real-time data sync. It also permits the integration of various other Google-based services in the application. And helps to provide security, and maintains the data risk-free, naming a few.

**Design:**

To define the layout of the android application, the features and functions of the application are explained.  When beginning the application for the very first time, individuals will be motivated by a login page. On the login option page, a different button is displayed. That is for new individuals that require to be signed up. The following figures reveal the login/register food selection.


After the authentication part, clients are moved to the primary display of the application and can see images posted by other people. Initially, it will be empty for new customers as the app does not have any other customers included in its user list. 
As pointed out previously, the application user interface has been separated right into three distinct components.
 They are the primary page that displays all the images from included customers, user-list where a customer of the app can view all the user signed up to the application and can also add or delete the pics from their user-list. Lastly, upload choice to upload own photo from the gadget, and also write a comment or caption. They can post it to the application. The following numbers reveal the application user interfaces.




To understand how the application was constructed, I will explain the actions taken to finish the task. There were a couple of applications and also libraries used to develop the app. They are:

* Install Android Studio Application
* Firebase used for authentication, Storage Space, and adding Realtime-Database.
* For fetching pictures from the Firebase, use Glide Library.
* Android Fragments are for dividing features into separate menus.

First of all, after producing a new task, login activity, as well as the registration page is developed. Using the Firebase tool in the Android Studio app, the Firebase connection is established. In my account in Firebase, a brand-new project was made where the new application was joined using the bundle name JSON file.

After the link, Firebase verification, storage, and real-time data source were contributed, to the app from the "assist" device of the Firebase in the Android Studio. Login, and Register Task, was created to ensure that customers can sign up to the app, and if they have registered then straight login and utilize the application. 

The "intent()" function is used in many ways in the application to leap from one activity to an additional after task conclusion. As an example, when login is successful, the application automatically changes to the main page.

A checker is implemented that sees if the individual is currently logged in to make sure that customers do not need to visit every time they open the application. 

To allow users to upload their pictures, a Message Activity is made, which takes the chosen image and caption was written text from the individual and submits it into the firebase database. 

The pictures published to the Firebase are saved in the Firebase Storage space as well as in the real-time data source, a download URL of the uploaded picture is kept in message format in addition to the individual's name and composed message( inscription).

In the activity, a feature had made to make sure that every customer has a unique login ID in the data source so that by making use of that distinct ID, published images/texts can be brought into the app. 

The unique login ID is also the factor that permitted me to produce a user-list feature in the app. Every unique ID from the database is brought in, into the user list, and then the customer adds one more customer from the checklist, in the database connection is being made that include which customer is contributed to whom and also based upon this added users-list from the data source, all their uploaded images/texts in the application.

As discussed previously, Instagram is among my most utilized application as well as the main ideas for the task, I attempted to emulate the features of Instagram as far as I could. Considering that Instagram has different menus for various functionalities, I decided to split the app interface into three principal departments with the Fragments in android studio. 

Fragments follow the same concept as a task but the distinction is that it permits various functions to be indifferent food selections. For the application, I made use of Android Fragments to build a resemble of Instagram as feasible. As many of the features are followed to recognize and apply it in my task, in the area "Limitations and project comments, I will describe carefully the standards utilized in the application.

<br />
<br />


The application development process has gone over how a customer will view the app. The steps are:
<br />

1. Firstly, a login menu will show up requesting individual E-mail and also passwords. With the correct credentials, individuals can sign in to the application.

2. If the customer is accessing the application for the first time, they will certainly need to pick the register switch. It will most likely redirect to the register web page, and the user needs to compose their name, complete name, email, and password.

3. After verification, the individuals are redirected to the main web screen of the application.  Here customers can see the main screen of the app. The users will be sent to the picture viewing screen, then in the future, the navigation bar, they can also add individuals or include images.

4. From the user list, customers can be chosen, and also the images/texts shared by those chosen users will be displayed in the picture on the screen. At any time, any customer can be de-selected.

5. Generally, on the screen, published image/text is shown, and with the scrolling down gesture, recently shared photos are seen.

6. From the bottom navigation food selection, the user can then share their images with inscriptions from the gadget. A menu with the picked picture is displayed, also a text area is offered for writing a text message. Choosing the click to share the image will post the photo/text and allow others to view the uploaded photos.



<br />

<br />

<br />

**Limitations:**

The android application developed is my 1st app, therefore some features do not work and also leads to crashing of the app with these features that I tried to carry out but failed. I will certainly detail the functionalities that I attempted to include however, fell short as well as functions that are missing from the app. They are as follows:

1. I attempted to make a customer profile, where all the info of a customer will reveal. From the user-list option, after selecting the customer's name, the profile was expected ahead up. After executing, it did not function as well as I could not deal with an unsuccessful reaction.

2. One of the main shortcomings of the app is that the individual can not watch their own shared messages. As in the code, I brought information from individuals that are in the user-list, the app reveals the blog posts from these individuals. I coded the app where customers could see their pictures however, I cannot incorporate the reasons for watching blog posts from other users. As the task due date was close, I did not intend to take any longer. And I decided to leave the alternative to watch my images.

3. The application does not include many functions expected from a social network platform application like messaging, alert, account editing and enhancing, changing account pictures, comments, likes, etc.  Many of these run out of the scope for the task. I think a notification feature, can be included by making use of the firebase notice manager.

4. As a whole, navigating the app is not at all smooth. After publishing pictures, there's a lag of a couple of seconds before posting it.

5. Although I attempted to make the interface appear like Instagram, the user interface itself is exactly suitable looking.



<br />

<br />

<br />


**Guidelines and Online resource used:**

As I pointed out earlier, a couple of standards (referenced) were complied with to complete this job. To mention the internet resources used for developing the application.

1. Firebase Documentation, "Include Firebase to the Android project": For including the Firebase database to your app.

2. A tutorial on the use of Glide collection to fetch pictures from Firebase has complied.

3. A write-up from Hackernoon.com on making applications like Instagram, and its resource guidelines were followed, for developing the interface.

4. Generally, random tutorials( stack overflow, youtube) were used when I was stuck to overcome errors.



<br />

<br />

<br />


**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the "ImageWorld" application enables users to share their pictures with a text message. It includes user credentials to be entered like E-mail /password and also gives user-customized photo viewing choices by including specific individuals to the user-based list. In its present way, the application is a straightforward image posting app that does not have cutting-edge capabilities. In this project documentation, I have explained the actions taken to produce the application, constraints, and referrals. I believe this application effectively satisfies the extent of the project. And also gives detailed documentation of its functions and also restrictions.

Attributes notice system that enables all the individuals to obtain direct notification messages from the firebase server can include in the future.
